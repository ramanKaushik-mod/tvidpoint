3rd SEM Minor Project

This App is all about tutorial videos which i have fetched from the best tutorial Youtube channels.
I have used Youtube APIs for the task of fetching videos and channel information.
For validating users, I have used Firebase connectivity.

Programming language is 'Dart' and framework is 'flutter'.



I have learned all the functionality, which is integrated in this project, is from youtube.
